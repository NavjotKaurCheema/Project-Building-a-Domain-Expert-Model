# Project-Building-a-Domain-Expert-Model
Utilizing Amazon Sagemaker and other AWS tools to fine-tune the Meta Llama 2 7B foundation model. This model has been trained for text-generation tasks. The goal is to adapt this model to your selected domain, enhancing its ability to understand and generate domain-specific text.

# Project Overview
This repository features a "Generative AI with AWS" initiative, which serves as a practical demonstration of fine-tuning large language models using AWS SageMaker. The project is aimed at enhancing students' expertise in machine learning and large language models (LLMs) by developing a model customized for a specific domain. Using AWS tools, the project focuses on training a language model to produce text that is both contextually relevant and accurate. A significant aspect of this project is the rigorous evaluation of the fine-tuned model compared to the original, ensuring the model's improvements and effectiveness.

# Project Objectives
The primary goal is to create a domain-specific language model for the Information Technology (IT) sector. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project trains and deploys a large language model on AWS SageMaker, enabling it to generate highly relevant and informative text responses within the IT domain.

# Dataset Details
The dataset used is centered around issues in ubiquitous data management within IT. It includes discussions on topics such as mobility support, context awareness, collaborative capabilities, adaptability, and user interactions in computing environments. This dataset is instrumental in fine-tuning the language model to enhance its expertise in generating IT-specific content.

# Project Workflow
# Dataset Selection:

Choose a relevant dataset that covers IT-related challenges and requirements.
# Environment Setup:
Configure an AWS SageMaker IAM Role to ensure the necessary permissions.
Set up an AWS SageMaker Notebook Instance for code development.
Request a GPU instance (ml.g5.2xlarge) to facilitate model fine-tuning.

# Model Fine-Tuning:
Deploy the Meta Llama 2 7B model on AWS SageMaker.
Use Python scripts to fine-tune the model with the IT dataset, improving its ability to understand and generate domain-specific text.

# Model Deployment:
Deploy the fine-tuned model on SageMaker for generating responses.

# Testing and Evaluation:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on IT-related tasks and queries( Dataset can be choosen as per requirement). Conduct a comparative analysis between the fine-tuned model and the original model to measure the improvements achieved through fine-tuning.
